Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.



SELECT f.X AS X1
      ,f.Y AS Y1
FROM Functions f
LEFT JOIN Functions f2 ON f.X=f2.Y
WHERE f2.X = f.Y 
GROUP BY X1,Y1
HAVING COUNT(*)>1 OR X1<Y1
ORDER BY f.X
